### We are finding maintainers, contact @sodastsai :)

Overcoat is a small but powerful library that makes creating REST clients simple and fun.
It provides a simple API for making requests and mapping responses to model objects.

Overcoat is built on top of [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) and
uses [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) to map responses into plain or Core Data model objects.

If you need to learn more about Mantle, we recommend these resources:

1. [Introduction](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle/blob/master/README.md).
2. [Better Web Clients with Mantle and AFNetworking](https://speakerdeck.com/gonzalezreal/better-web-clients-with-mantle-and-afnetworking).

**Overcoat 4.0** is the latest major release and introduces several API-breaking changes to
support envelop and error responses, Core Data serialization, and a new method to specify how to
map responses to model objects.

If you are upgraded from Overcoat 3.x, check [the migration note]( https://github.com/Overcoat/Overcoat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrate-from-3x)

## Requirements

Overcoat supports OS X 10.9+ and iOS 7.0+.


## Installation

### Using CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile` and run `$ pod install`.

``` ruby
pod 'Overcoat', '~> 4.0.0-beta.1'
```

If you don't have CocoaPods installed or integrated into your project,
you can learn how to do so [here](http://cocoapods.org).

### Using Carthage

Add the following to your `Cartfile` and run `$ carthage update`.

```
github "Overcoat/Overcoat" "4.0.0-beta.1"
```

If you don't have Carthage installed or integrated into your project,
you can learn how to do so [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).


## Sample Code

Overcoat includes a simple [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1) client that shows some new features:

* Mapping model classes to resource paths.
* Specifying an error model class.
* Core Data serialization.
* Promises.

You can find the sample code [here](https://github.com/Overcoat/TwitterTimelineExample).
Note that you'll need to run `pod install` to install all the dependencies.


## Usage

### Creating a Client Class
Overcoat provides 2 different classes to subclass when creating your own clients:

Class                                   | Usage
----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`OVCHTTPSessionManager`                 | Using with NSURLSession and Mantle
`OVCManagedHTTPSessionManager`          | Using with NSURLSession, Mantle, and CoreData. This is also a subclass of `OVCHTTPSessionManager`

Both classes have identical APIs.

```objc
#import <Overcoat/Overcoat.h>

@interface TwitterClient : OVCHTTPSessionManager
...
@end
```

### Specifying Model Classes

To specify how responses should be mapped to model classes you must override `+modelClassesByResourcePath`
and return a dictionary mapping resource paths to model classes.

```objc
+ (NSDictionary *)modelClassesByResourcePath {
    return @{
        @"statuses/*": [Tweet class],
        @"users/*": [TwitterUser class],
        @"friends/ids.json": [UserIdentifierCollection class],
        @"followers/ids.json": [UserIdentifierCollection class]
    };
}
```

You don't need to specify the full path, and you can use `*` and `**` to match any text or `#` to match only digits.

If you use `*` and `#`, they are **strict path matchings**, so **the number of path components must be equal**. The `**` just matches any text and has no path components number limitation.

Match String          | Path                           | Result
--------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------
`statuses/*`          | `statues/user_timeline`        | Matched
`statuses/#`          | `statues/user_timeline`        | Missed (wrong type, the path component after `statuses` should be dights only)
`statuses/*`          | `statues/retweets/12345`       | Missed (wrong number of path components, there should be only one  path component after `statuses`)
`statuses/*/*`        | `statues/retweets/12345`       | Matched
`statuses/**`         | `statues/retweets/12345`       | Matched
`statuses/**`         | `statues/retweets/12345/extra` | Matched (the number of path components doesn't matter)
`statuses/retweets/*` | `statues/retweets/12345`       | Matched
`statuses/retweets/#` | `statues/retweets/12345`       | Matched


Also you can specify different model classes by request method or response status code, like:

```objc
+ (NSDictionary *)modelClassesByResourcePath {
    return @{
        @"statuses/*": [Tweet class],
        @"users/*": @{
            @"PUT": [UpdatedTwitterUser class],  // For PUT request method,
            @"201": [NewCreatedTwitterUser class],  // For 201 response status code
            @"*": [TwitterUser class],  // For all other cases, as fallback
        },
        @"friends/ids.json": [UserIdentifierCollection class],
        @"followers/ids.json": [UserIdentifierCollection class]
    };
}
```

Check the documentation of `OVCURLMatcherNode` for further explaination.


### Envelop and Error Responses

Different REST APIs have different ways of dealing with status and other metadata.

Pure REST services like **Twitter** use HTTP status codes and a specific JSON response to communicate errors;
 and HTTP headers for other metadata like rate limits. For these kind of services, you may want to override
 `+errorModelClassesByResourcePath` to map error responses into your own model.

```objc
+ (Class)errorModelClassesByResourcePath {
    return @{@"**": [TwitterErrorResponse class]};
}
```

Other services like **App.net** use an envelop response, which is a top level JSON response containing
the data requested and additional metadata. For these kind of services, you must create your own `OVCResponse`
subclass and specify the data key path.

```objc
@interface AppDotNetResponse : OVCResponse
...
@end

@implementation AppDotNetResponse
+ (NSString *)resultKeyPathForJSONDictionary:(NSDictionary *)JSONDictionary {
    return @"data";
}
@end
```

You can then specify which response class to use in your client by overriding `+responseClassesByResourcePath`.

```objc
+ (Class)responseClassesByResourcePath {
    return @{@"**": [AppDotNetResponse class]};
}
```

### Core Data Serialization

To support CoreData serialization, you have to use `CoreData` subspec if you're using CocoaPods

``` ruby
pod 'Overcoat/CoreData', '~> 4.0'  # Use this,
pod 'Overcoat', :subspecs => ['CoreData'], '~> 4.0'  # Or this if you want to apply multiple subspecs.
```

Or if you are using Carthage, you also have to add `OvercoatCoreData.framework` to your project.

And the main classes would be changed to `OVCManaged` prefixed one. (For instance,
`OVCHTTPSessionManager` -> `OVCManagedHTTPSessionManager`)

If you initialize your client with a valid `NSManagedObjectContext`,
it will automatically persist any model object(s) parsed from a response,
if the model supports Core Data serialization (that is, implements `MTLManagedObjectSerializing`).

Note that, if you provide a context with an `NSMainQueueConcurrencyType`,
a private context will be created to perform insertions in the background.

You can see Core Data Serialization in action in the [provided example](https://github.com/Overcoat/TwitterTimelineExample).


### Making HTTP Requests

```objc
// Lookup Twitter users
NSDictionary *parameters = @{
    @"screen_name": @"gonzalezreal",
    @"user_id": @"42,3141592"
};

[twitterClient GET:@"users/lookup.json" parameters:parameters completion:^(OVCResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    NSArray *users = response.result; // This is an array of TwitterUser objects!
}];
```

Note that Overcoat automatically parses the JSON into model objects, that is, in this case `response.result`
contains an array of `TwitterUser` objects.

#### ReactiveCocoa

From 2.0, Overcoat adds support for [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa).

To add ReactiveCocoa support, you have to use `ReactiveCocoa` subpec if you're using CocoaPods.
Or if you're using Carthage, add `OvercoatReactiveCocoa.framework`

Now you can make HTTP requests and get cold signals to handle responses:

```objc
#import <Overcoat/OvercoatReactiveCocoa.h>
...
[[twitterClient rac_GET:@"users/lookup.json" parameters:parameters] subscribeNext:^(OVCResponse *response) {
    ...
} error:^(NSError *e) {
    ...
}];
```

#### PromiseKit

If you're looking for a better way to handle asynchronous calls but you're not ready to embrace ReactiveCocoa,
you may try [PromiseKit](http://promisekit.org).

To add ReactiveCocoa support, you have to use `PromiseKit` subpec if you're using CocoaPods.
Or if you're using Carthage, add `OvercoatPromiseKit.framework`

Now you can get `PMKPromise` objects when making HTTP requests:

```objc
#import <Overcoat/PromiseKit+Overcoat.h>
...
[twitterClient pmk_GET:@"users/lookup.json" parameters:parameters].then(^(OVCResponse *response) {
    return response.result;
});
```

## Testing the library

In order to build the library and run unit tests, you will first need to install 2 tools: `cocoapods` and `xctool`
* cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org
* xctool: https://github.com/facebook/xctool

After you setup these tools (or you already have these tools), you could run tests via
```bash
make test
```

Check the `Makefile` to run other test target.
